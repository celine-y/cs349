# Assignment 2
When running compiling using gradle, the `gradle run` command accepts fps and then speed, respectively.
To do this, run `gradle run --args='40 20'` where fps=40 and speed=20.

This breakout game is resizable and has a paper theme. The rate and speed can also be changed using the settings button. This will also pause the game.

An additional feature that was added is allowing the platform to be sped up. This can be achieved by pressing the spacebar at the same time as the arrow keys.

Press 'esc' to quit the game, once it has started.
